## Character Creator

A question-and-answer driven character creation tool for basic D&D. The user is asked four questions which are processed together to return:

*Six stats and modifiers, randomly generated then adjusted based on choices.
*Character portrait
*Class
*Starting equipment
*Backstory for why the character is who they are, and why they are adventuring.
